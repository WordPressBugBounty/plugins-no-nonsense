The fastest, cleanest way to get rid of the parts of WordPress you don't need.

== Description ==

For professional developers working with WordPress, the first steps in any new build frequently involve deleting default content and turning off built-in settings. This plugin encapsulates many of those tasks on a single, clean configuration screen.

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed and activated the plugin, now what? =

After installing the plugin, navigate to **Settings &gt; No Nonsense** to choose which built-in WordPress features you want to turn off. Be sure to click **Save Changes** when you're done.

== Changelog ==

= 3.6.2 - 2025.03.26 =

* Added server IP address to sidebar on admin page, and also to the **Server** section of the **Site Health** page. Server IP address value may vary in configurations using load balancing; regardless, the absence of this value anywhere on the Site Health page seems to be a curious oversight. There is no ready means within WordPress admin to determine the IP address of the server, which can be useful in situations where a site is being moved, and an admin wants to determine if they're accessing the new server or the old server. (If you believe there is any way that the server IP address is sensitive _in the context of the Site Health screen_ please let me know in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/no-nonsense/).)
* Changed help text for the **Remove Comments from admin** option.
* i18n: Updated translation strings.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.7.2.

= 3.6.1.1 - 2025.02.07 =

* Bug fix: Resolved possible fatal error caused if new `r34nono_i18n_locales()` function added in 3.6.1 runs on a logged-out front-end page.

= 3.6.1 - 2025.02.06 =

* Updated translation handling and various other minor adjustments to improve validation with [Plugin Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) plugin.
* i18n: Updated translation strings. Added logic to force loading of embedded translation files rather than the WordPress default community translations. Note: Embedded translation files are machine translated, and may contain errors, but this decision was made after we observed that the community files were not being kept up-to-date. It is our opinion that complete, but slightly inaccurate, translations are preferable to a hodgepodge of half translations and half English. The embedded translation files will always be kept current any time new translatable text is added to the plugin. (Current embedded translation files are limited to German and Dutch.)

= 3.6.0 - 2025.02.04 =

* Added **Disable Post Via Email** and **Disable Update Services** settings (under Admin Features).
* Added **Require login** setting (under Login). Useful for sites that are in development and should not be publicly accessible.
* Updated **Remove Comments from admin** to include hiding the "Recent Comments" section of the **Activity** section on the Dashboard. _Note: Hides the block with CSS rather than removing it, because the function that generates this output (`wp_dashboard_recent_comments()`), and the one that calls it (`wp_dashboard_site_activity()`), contain no hooks._
* Minor code refactoring.
* i18n: Updated translation files with new text strings.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.7.1.

= 3.5.1 - 2024.12.02 =

* Deferred all text translations that previously loaded on the `plugins_loaded` hook, to prevent `_load_textdomain_just_in_time`-related notices after changes in WordPres 6.7:
  * Restructured `R34NoNo::settings` array to put all translation strings into a deferred method that only loads on the No Nonsense admin page, which also eliminates unnecessary translation processing.
  * Removed the unused `R34NoNo::functions` property and replaced `R34NoNo::utilities` with an array that is only defined when the admin page is being loaded, since the information is only needed on that page.
* Added conditional to check for `is_plugin_active()` function before defining plugin-specific settings. (This had not previously revealed itself to be an issue, because the `R34NoNo::_get_version()` method already loads the `wp-admin/includes/plugin.php` file. This change alleviates the unintended dependence on that method.)
* i18n:
	* Updated `no-nonsense.pot` file with new translation strings.
  * Removed the plugin name "No Nonsense" from translatable text.
  * Added embedded translation files for German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and Dutch (Netherlands, Belgium).
* Hotfix: Added workaround for version number not updating after change to initialization hook.

_Note: If your locale is set to Germany or the Netherlands, the incomplete, community-translated files for these languages may load instead of the ones embedded in the plugin, or the plugin's versions may get replaced by the community versions if you click **Update Translations** on the Updates page. Manually deleting the No Nonsense-related files from `wp-content/languages/plugins` will revert to using the plugin-embedded versions. We are currently investigating the issue._

= 3.5.0.2 - 2024.12.02 =

* Modified conditional so **Also kill any incoming XML-RPC request** only applies if **Disable XML-RPC** is checked. _Unchecking a top-level setting does not automatically reset its sub-settings. This is by design, so previous sub-settings are "remembered" if a setting is turned back on. In all other cases within the plugin, those sub-settings are contained within hooked functions that don't run anyway unless the top-level setting is turned on. The XML-RPC logic needs to run earlier, outside of a hooked function, and as a result it needed this extra conditional._

= 3.5.0.1 - 2024.12.02 =

* Bumped version to allow users who updated to 3.5.0 within an hour of its release to pick up the hotfix that was added to address the `get_plugin_data()` issue.

= 3.5.0 -  2024.10.03 =

* Added new **Plugins** tab. Future updates will conditionally include settings for some popular plugins, which will display only if the relevant plugin is installed and active. *Note: If no plugins are installed for which settings exist, the **Plugins** tab itself will not appear.* Some plugin-specific options may also be incorporated into existing settings where relevant, e.g. under **Remove Dashboard widgets.**
* Removed unnecessary `load_plugin_textdomain()` call, and set `$translate` input parameter to `false` on `get_plugin_data()` call, as it may cause PHP notices as of WordPress 6.7. See the [WordPress Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62154#comment:8) for more details.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with new translation strings.

= 3.4.0 - 2024.08.22 =

* Added **Disable author archives** setting. Based partially on the [Disable Author Archives](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-author-archives/) plugin by [@freemp](https://profiles.wordpress.org/freemp/).
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with new translation strings.

= 3.3.3 - 2024.08.16 =

* Moved logic to kill any incoming XML-RPC request out of the `r34nono_xmlrpc_disabled()` function and into a conditional that runs directly in the `no-nonsense.php` file when the plugin is loading. The previous approach did not kill the request early enough, and would still return a WordPress XML-RPC status message with an HTTP 405 status. The new approach correctly returns a blank page with a 403 status.

= 3.3.2.2 - 2024.07.25 =

* Changed priorities for actions that call `r34nono_admin_bar_logout_link_admin_bar_menu_callback()` and `r34nono_remove_howdy()` to `PHP_INT_MAX - 100`, to account for changes introduced in WP core version 6.6.1. In `wp-includes/class-wp-admin-bar.php`, priorities for three actions in the `WP_Admin_Bar::add_menus()` method were changed from 4, 7, and 8 to 9991, 9992, and 9999. See Trac tickets [#61615](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61615) and [#61738](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61738) for discussion of this change, and the issues it introduces. At this point it is possible the core team may revert the change, but our modified priority should continue to work either way.
* Added conditional in `r34nono_remove_howdy()` to prevent possible PHP warnings if `$wp_admin_bar` node `my-account` is undefined when the function runs. (In practice this should be resolved by the aforementioned priority change.)
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.6.1.

= 3.3.2.1 - 2024.06.04 =

* Added declaration of `R34NoNo::settings` property to prevent deprecation notices.

= 3.3.2 - 2024.04.23 =

* New logic for handling the current plugin version number.
* Bumped 'tested up to' to 6.5.2.

= 3.3.1 - 2023.11.20 =

* Added `WHERE` clause to SQL queries in *Disable all comments and trackbacks*, to only alter records where the status equals `open`.

= 3.3.0 - 2023.11.08 =

* Added new **Disable all comments and trackbacks** utility.
* Added version number to script enqueuing to fix issue of some JavaScript not functioning properly immediately after a plugin update, due to browser caching.
* Minified JavaScript and CSS files.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with new translation strings.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.4. (This was an earlier hotfix.)

= 3.2.2 - 2023.04.21 =

* Replaced instances of `filter_var()` using the `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` (deprecated in PHP 8.1) with a new custom `r34nono_sanitize_string()` function, which runs both `strip_tags()` and `htmlspecialchars()` on the input string.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.2. (This was an earlier hotfix.)

= 3.2.1.2 - 2022.12.29 =

* Added conditional to `r34nono_admin_colors_css_variables()` to prevent PHP notice, and added default values for the CSS variables, if user's admin color palette can't be loaded.

= 3.2.1.1 - 2022.12.21 =

* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with new translation strings.

= 3.2.1 - 2022.12.21 =

* Changed the way anchor links are constructed for secondary tab bar on admin page to resolve issues with translations in anchor links' `id` attributes. Anchors for secondary tab items now are numbered, rather than using "sanitized" group label. This is because `sanitize_title()` is [unsuitable in HTML attributes for Chinese characters](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/sanitize_title/#comment-4330).
* Modified JSON export to prevent export if there are unsaved changes to settings.
* Further improvements to JavaScript for tabs on initial page load.

= 3.2.0 - 2022.12.20 =

* Added **Import/Export** feature, using a JSON format. Useful if you are setting up multiple sites that all use the same settings, or if you prefer a quick code-based way to adjust your settings. Uses multiple layers of validation and sanitization to prevent abuse or accidental entry of invalid settings data.
* Improved JavaScript for tabs on initial page load.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with new translation strings.

= 3.1.0 - 2022.12.20 =

* Modified new interface tab underlines and toggle buttons to use the selected admin color palette, rather than No Nonsense brand colors.
* Added color functions to generate CSS variables for colors in the admin color palette, for use on the admin page and in the admin bar logout link. (These CSS variables are only loaded on the No Nonsense admin page, unless the admin bar logout link is turned on, in which case they are loaded on all admin pages. They are not loaded on any front-end pages, because WordPress does not apply admin colors to the admin bar on the front end.)

= 3.0.0 - 2022.12.17 =

* Redesigned admin user interface with tabbed layout and visual toggle buttons.

= 2.7.0 - 2022.12.06 =

* Added *Prevent block directory access* setting. This prevents the directory of installable blocks from appearing when a user searches for blocks in the block editor sidebar.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.1.1.

= 2.6.1 - 2022.11.16 =

* Restored **Delete inactive themes** utility, with a new restriction that prevents it from running on Multisite installations.
* Removed some commented-out options for deprecated WordPress features.
* Removed deprecated `r34nono_define_functions_array` filter. (This filter never should have been used by any third-party developers, as it was renamed to `r34nono_define_settings_array` almost immediately.)
* Updated help box for **Remove default tagline** utility to indicate that the default tagline was removed from WordPress core in version 6.1. This utility has no effect unless the old default tagline is still in place on any given site.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with updated translation strings.

= 2.6.0 - 2022.11.11 =

* Added **Redirect attachment pages to file URL** setting.

= 2.5.4 - 2022.11.06 =

* Temporarily removed **Delete inactive themes** utility, pending further testing with Multisite installations.
* Added warning text in Utilities section for utilities that make permanent, irreversible changes.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with updated translation strings.

= 2.5.3 - 2022.11.05 =

* Added warning to **Delete sample content** utility, indicating that the sample content is deleted solely based on IDs; if they have been edited and are in use, they will still be deleted. (This can be especially of concern for developers who have the habit of repurposing the Sample Page as the site's home page.)
* Added `.warning` CSS class to admin settings page to call attention to help hover boxes that contain important warnings (such as **Delete sample content** as described above.)
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with updated translation strings.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 6.1.

= 2.5.2 - 2022.09.01 =

This is a usability/refactoring update. There are no functional changes to the capabilities of the plugin.

* Additional refactoring of `no-nonsense.php`. Split `r34nono_install()` function into separate `r34nono_install()` and `r34nono_update()` functions so only the relevant logic runs on initial activation vs. subsequent updates. (For example, this prevents the new introductory admin notice from displaying every time the plugin is updated.)
* Changed conditional for running update function to use `version_compare()`, rather than just checking for an unequal value.
* Reversed logic for version-specific conditional updates to check against old version, rather than new version. (This should clarify when the logic needs to run and eliminate some unnecessary processing.)
* Renamed `r34nono_install_admin_notices()` function to `r34nono_deferred_admin_notices()` for clarity of purpose. (Note: The old function name has *not* been retained as a deprecated function.)

= 2.5.1.1 - 2022.08.31 =

* Removed `flush_rewrite_rules()` from `r34nono_install()` to resolve fatal error on upgrade when running WordPress 4.9.

= 2.5.1 - 2022.08.27 =

This is a usability/refactoring update. There are no functional changes to the capabilities of the plugin.

* Added admin notice upon activation to help steer new users to the Settings page.
* Added Settings link on Plugins page.
* Refactored plugin initialization code in `no-nonsense.php`.
* Redesigned sidebar of admin page.
* Added No Nonsense icon file.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` with updated translation strings.

= 2.5.0 - 2022.08.15 =

* Added "Remove global styles (inline CSS)" setting. This dequeues the `global-styles` CSS that inserts color- and font-related inline CSS into the HTML `head` of every page.

= 2.4.1 - 2022.07.26 =

* Updated "Disable site search" option to support Block Editor (unregisters core search block).
* Fixed: Changed priority on `after_setup_theme` hook call to `R34NoNo::add_hooks()` from default `10` to `9` to resolve issue of "Remove Widgets block editor" not working.

= 2.4.0.1 - 2022.07.19 =

* Fixed: Changed logic when writing settings to `wp_options` table (`R34NoNo::admin_page_callback()` method) so keys are no longer required to begin with `r34nono_`.

= 2.4.0 - 2022.07.15 =

* Added "Deactivate and delete Akismet Anti-Spam plugin" utility. _Note: We do recommend using Akismet or something similar to prevent spam on your website, but if your site does not support comments, and/or you already intend to secure it by other means, Akismet itself may not be necessary._
* Added "Delete inactive themes" utility.
* Added JavaScript confirmation on **Run Selected Utilities** button.
* Edited redundant description of "Deactivate and delete Hello Dolly plugin" utility.
* i18n: Updated `no-nonsense.pot` file with new/changed text strings.

= 2.3.2 - 2022.07.15 =

* Moved new filters into `R34NoNo::add_hooks()` method, and delayed execution of that method to the `after_setup_theme` action, to resolve issue of themes' use of the new filters having no effect.

= 2.3.1 - 2022.07.12 =

* Changed name of class array (again) from `functions` to `settings` to reduce potential confusion for developers using the hooks introduced in 2.3.0. Also changed the name of the hook from `r34nono_define_functions_array` to `r34nono_define_settings_array` (retaining deprecated name for backwards compatibility).

= 2.3.0.1 - 2022.07.12 =

* Added sanitization function on keys when saving to `wp_options` table.

= 2.3.0 - 2022.07.12 =

* Added `r34nono_define_functions_array` and `r34nono_define_utilities_array` filters to allow developers to add (or remove) functions and utilities to No Nonsense from their themes or plugins. Usage is outlined in our [Developer Documentation](https://nononsensewp.com/developer.php).
* Added `show_in_admin` to each function and utility, allowing developers to hide options in the admin, but still have them function via hardcoded values in themes or plugins. (Use in conjunction with the aforementioned filters.)
* Changed names of class arrays from `function_details` and `utility_details` to `functions` and `utilities`.
* Added sanitization functions on dynamic `add_action()` and `add_filter()` in `R34NoNo::__construct()` method, in preparation for adding filters for developers to extend this plugin's functionality.
* Added tooltips to status color dots on admin notice after running utilities.
* Minor refactoring of `R34NoNo::__construct()` method.

= 2.2.0 - 2022.06.20 =

* Added "Remove default block patterns" option. This turns off all of the core block patterns, which may not match your theme, but retains the ability for you to create your own custom block patterns.
* Added "Block Editor" section to admin screen and reorganized all block editor-related options into that section.
* Updated text strings. (Removed somewhat inconsistent use of capitalization for terms such as "block editor," "block patterns," and "full site editing.")
* Removed "(BETA)" label on "Remove comments from front end" option on admin page.

= 2.1.1 - 2022.05.22 =

* Fixed **Deactivate and delete Hello Dolly plugin** utility to handle both a manually installed instance (where Hello Dolly is contained in a `hello-dolly` folder) and the base install instance (where Hello Dolly is a bare `hello.php` file in the `plugins` folder). *(Opinionated side note: This is yet another argument for why Hello Dolly is a **bad** example of how to create a plugin, which is ostensibly one of its intended reasons for inclusion in the core installation.)*

= 2.1.0 - 2022.05.19 =

* Changed success/fail indicator UTF-8 characters in admin notices when running utilities, from check mark and X to "black circle" (colored green, orange or red), because WordPress 6.0 forces conversion of those UTF characters to emoji, which causes them not to render if the "Remove WP emoji" option is turned on!
* Modified utility functions to return true or false depending on whether or not they completed their intended actions, so admin notice "black circle" icons are colored accordingly: green for success; orange if the function ran but did not have an effect; and red for an error.
* Removed action hook to `r34nono_deactivate_and_delete_hello_dolly_admin_head_callback()` in `r34nono_deactivate_and_delete_hello_dolly()` because now that this is a utility, rather than a setting that runs on every admin page load, the function would not be firing anyway. The function has been retained in the plugin however and will not be deprecated.
* i18n: Added text domain to "Just another WordPress site" string.

= 2.0.0 - 2022.05.03 =

* Added new **Utilities** section with a set of one-time actions that are frequently part of the new site installation process.
* Moved **Deactivate and delete Hello Dolly plugin** to **Utilities**, so it only runs once.
* Minor interface refinements.

= 1.9.0 - 2022.05.02 =

* Added BETA **Remove comments from front end** option. This option uses standard hooks to hide comment output, along with a workaround for a deprecated backwards compatibility file, but it may not completely remove all traces of comments from the front end of your site, depending on its theme structure. Please provide any feedback you have on this functionality in the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/no-nonsense/).

= 1.8.1 - 2022.05.02 =

* Added **Disallow Full Site Editing** option to extend upon **Remove "Edit site" link**. This option removes the "Edit site" link in the admin bar, the "Editor" link under "Appearance" in the admin menu, the FSE notice in the Customizer, and force-redirects any direct attempts to access the FSE editing screen to the admin dashboard.

= 1.8.0 - 2022.04.21 =

* Added **Remove "Edit site" link** option to suppress the Full Site Editing link in the front-end admin bar on sites that use Block Themes.
* Refactored logic for **Remove Comments from admin** to properly hide the comment count in the front-end admin bar.

= 1.7.0 - 2022.04.18 =

* Added **Remove duotone SVG filters** option to suppress Block Editor's duotone filter HTML SVG tags for Safari users.
* Bumped *Tested up to* to 5.9.3.

= 1.6.1.1 - 2022.02.28 =

* Corrected text domain in `load_plugin_textdomain()` function call.

= 1.6.1 - 2022.02.18 =

* Added **Remove admin email check interval** option to suppress periodic verification of the admin email address upon login.

= 1.6.0.1 - 2021.12.27 =

* Changed hook for **Remove front end Edit links** to fix an issue that may have prevented edit links from working on the admin side.

= 1.6.0 - 2021.12.27 =

* i18n: Numbered all placeholders in `sprintf()` functions.
* i18n: Added text domain path `i18n/languages` and created `.pot` file.
* Removed stray `xmlrpc_enabled` filter in main plugin file.

= 1.5.1 - 2021.12.22 =

* Changed optional custom site icon on login screen to use a 16-pixel border radius, to match how the icon is displayed in the Customizer.

= 1.5.0 - 2021.12.21 =

* Added **Remove front end Edit links** option. (Thanks to @ov3rfly for this suggestion and several others.)
* Changed priority on removing comments from admin bar to account for potential activity by other plugins.
* Changed `fn` key to `cb` in `R34NoNo::function_details()` for less potential confusion on its purpose.
* Changed **Remove Posts from admin** hook run on `init` (with other enclosed hooks as appropriate) and to include removal of New Post option from admin bar.
* For those who *really* don't want "Hello Dolly" around, this version now also hides it in the "Add Plugins" search results, via CSS.
* Refactored **Remove Howdy** to remove greeting before username in *all* languages.
* Refactored `r34nono_install()` function to fix issues with updating version number and resetting deprecated option names.
* Replaced all closures with named callback functions.
* Return HTTP 301 status (instead of `wp_redirect()` default 302) on searches when **Disable site search** is turned on.
* Updated admin page sidebar content.
* Updated plugin description in `no-nonsense.php` to match `readme.txt`.

= 1.4.4 - 2021.12.20 =

* Added "Also prevent access to profile screen" option under **Redirect admin to home page for logged-in non-editors**. (Thanks to @dcavins for suggesting this change.)
* Fixed issue with **Replace WP logo with site icon on login screen** CSS when site icon is not set (hotfix).

= 1.4.3.1 - 2021.12.19 =

* Changed `r34nono_remove_head_tags()` to hook into `init` instead of `wp_head` to ensure that all enclosed hooks are applied in time.

= 1.4.3 - 2021.12.19 =

* Added **Remove admin color scheme picker**.
* Added dynamic sorting of functions alphabetically by title on admin screen, to keep the list organized as the set of options grows.

= 1.4.2 - 2021.12.19 =

* Added HTTP 403 status when XML-RPC requests are killed.
* Added logic to remove HTTP response headers for WP Shortlink and REST API.
* Added logic to also remove resource hints from login screen when set for the front end.
* Added "oEmbed Discovery Links" option in **Remove head tags**.
* Corrected checkbox label "Quick Press" to "Quick Draft" in dashboard widget options.
* Fixed priority on `remove_action()` for REST API.
* Modified admin bar logout button to use admin color scheme.
* Removed `likes` column from functionality affected by **Remove Comments from admin** because it is not part of WP core.
* Refactored `r34nono_remove_head_tags()` to use `switch` instead of `if / elseif / else`.
* Specified PHP 7.0.0 minimum requirement in readme file.

= 1.4.1 - 2021.12.18 =

* Added **Remove Posts from admin**, **Disable site search**, and **Disallow theme and plugin file editing** options.
* Fix: Changed `r34nono_core_upgrade_skip_new_bundled` hook type from `filter` to `action.

= 1.4.0 - 2021.12.18 =

**NOTE** Two options' function names have changed in this version. The update script should automatically transfer their settings over to their replacements. However, you are encouraged to review your settings after running the update.

* Added **Remove head tags**, with options to turn off a number of `<link>` tags that WordPress inserts by default in the `<head>` of every page.
* Changed **Remove WordPress logo on login screen** to **Replace WP logo with site icon on login screen**. This will use the designated site icon and change the URL to the site's home page. If there is no designated site icon, the icon will simply be removed instead.
* Modified **Remove Comments from admin** functionality to also remove comments (and likes) columns from admin index pages for Posts, Pages and Media Library. (Does not change settings for any custom post types.)
* Modified **Disable XML-RPC** functionality to add the option to immediately kill incoming XML-RPC requests. Due to the fact that this is a plugin-based solution, you may find it more effective to block access to `xmlrpc.php` directly in your site's `.htaccess` file.

= 1.3.0 - 2021.12.18 =

* Added **Admin bar logout link** option.
* Refactored CSS.
* Fixed link error in sidebar on admin page.

= 1.2.0 - 2021.12.17 =

* Added option to deactivate, delete and prevent reinstallation of [Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly) plugin.

= 1.1.1 - 2021.12.15 =

* Changed all instances of `esc_html()` to `wp_kses_post()` on admin page.
* Removed unnecessary `NAMESPACE` constant from `R34NoNo` class.
* New branding assets.

= 1.1.0 - 2021.12.14 =

* Initial WordPress Plugin Directory version.
* Added option to deactivate Widgets Block Editor.
* Added option to remove Dashboard widgets, and related functionality to support sub-options on admin page.
* Duplicated Save Changes button at top of form.
* Updated sidebar on admin page.
	* Changed donation button to make it less likely to be mistaken for the Save Changes button.
	* Fixed links.
	* i18n: Added translation strings. (Translation files are not yet present.)
* Updated readme content and tags.
* Added input value filtering on `update_option()`.
* Added `esc_html()` on all variable output on admin page.
* Changed text domain to conform with plugin directory requirements.

= 1.0.0 - 2021.12.13 =

* Original version.

== Upgrade Notice ==
